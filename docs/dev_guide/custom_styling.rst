Custom Styling
===============

The BLAST module forms can be styled using CSS stylesheets in your own theme. By default it will use the default form themeing provided by your particular Drupal site allowing it to feel consistent with the look-and-feel of your Tripal site without customization being needed.

Additionally, the results page, waiting pages and the alignment section of the results page have their own template files (``blast_report.tpl.php``, ``blast_report_pending.tpl.php``, and ``blast_report_alignment_row.tpl.php``, respectively) which can easily be overridden in your own theme providing complete control over the look of the BLAST results.
